%The online English version of this book is currently publicly available and open-source. % \textcolor{red}{The Chinese version}
In the process of writing this book, a large number of documents and papers have been referenced. Most of the theoretical knowledge of mathematics is the result of previous research, not my original creation. A small part of the experimental design also comes from various open-source code demonstration programs, but most of them are written by myself. In addition, there are some pictures taken from published journals or conference papers, which have been cited in the text. Unexplained images are either original or fetched from the Internet. I don’t want to infringe anyone’s picture copyright. If readers find any problems, please contact me to modify it. 

As I'm not a native English speaker, the translation work is based on Google translation and some afterward modifications. If you think the quality of translation can be improved and willing to do this, please contact me or send an issue on Github. Any help will be welcome!

Thanks for the following friend's help in the translation time: Nicolas Rosa, Carrie (Yan Ran), Collen Jones, Hong Ma. And also, thanks for your attention and support!
